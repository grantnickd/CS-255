DriverPass System Analysis and Design
This repository contains my work for the DriverPass project, including the Business Requirements Document (Project One) and the System Design Document (Project Two). These documents demonstrate my ability to collect system requirements from a client and design a functional system based on those needs. Below, I reflect on my experience with these projects and the skills I developed.

Project Summary
The DriverPass project was for a client, Liam, who wanted to develop an online system to help students prepare for their driver’s license exams. The system needed to provide study materials, online practice tests, and a scheduling feature for in-person driving lessons. Additionally, the system required secure user management, role-based access control, and tracking for lesson bookings and modifications. The goal was to create a web-based and mobile-accessible platform that streamlined the learning and booking process for students.

What I Did Well
One of the aspects I did particularly well was gathering and organizing system requirements in a structured way. I ensured that all functional and nonfunctional requirements were well-documented in the Business Requirements Document, making it easy to transition into the system design phase. Additionally, my UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams) provided clear visual representations of system processes, helping to define how different components would interact.

Potential Revisions and Improvements
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would refine the user interface design and adaptability section in the System Design Document. While I outlined the key features and interactions, I could improve the details on accessibility considerations and future scalability. Adding mockups or wireframes would make the UI design more concrete and provide better visualization for stakeholders.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
To interpret the user’s needs, I analyzed the DriverPass interview transcript to extract critical requirements, such as the ability to book lessons online, track user progress, and integrate secure authentication. These needs were incorporated into the system design through role-based access control, encrypted data storage, and an intuitive booking system. Understanding user needs is crucial because designing a system that aligns with user expectations improves usability, efficiency, and overall satisfaction. By focusing on user experience (UX) principles, I ensured that the system was intuitive and met the client's business goals.

Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies
My approach to software design follows a structured methodology, beginning with requirement gathering, followed by UML diagramming, system architecture planning, and implementation considerations. I applied a mix of process modeling (for structured development) and object modeling (for system scalability). In the future, I plan to incorporate Agile methodologies more effectively, using iterative development and prototyping to ensure continuous feedback and improvement. Additionally, I would improve my use of wireframing tools to better visualize UI/UX early in the design phase.
